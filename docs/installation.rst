Ansible Installer (Recommended)
-------------------------------

We recommend that you install `pulpcore` and `pulp-file` together using the `Ansible installer
<https://github.com/pulp/ansible-pulp/blob/master/README.md>`_. The remaining steps are all
performed by the installer and are not needed if you use it.

`installed pulpcore <https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/3.0/nightly/installation/instructions.html>`_

Users should install from **either** PyPI or source.
