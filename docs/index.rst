``pulp_file`` Plugin
====================

This is the ``pulp_file`` Plugin for `Pulp Project
3.0+ <https://pypi.org/project/pulpcore/>`__. This plugin replaces the ISO support in the
``pulp_rpm`` plugin for Pulp 2.

How to use these docs
---------------------

The documentation here should be considered **the primary documentation for managing File
content**.

All relevent workflows are covered here, with references to pulpcore supplemental docs. Users may
also find `pulpcore's conceptual docs <https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulpcore/concepts.html>`_
helpful. Here, the documentation falls into two main categories:

  1. :ref:`workflows-index` show the **major features** of the File plugin, with links to reference
     docs.
  2. `REST API Docs <restapi.html>`_ are automatically generated and are responsible for containing
     thorough information for each **minor feature**, including all fields and options.
